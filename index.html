	<fieldset id="cmsc">
		<legend class="font-effect-outline">Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</legend>
		My favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 130 because it is like a summary or a review of the lessons that we had during our first year. 
		I also liked my lecturer and lab instructor in this subject as they were very patient in answering my questions and they always try to make sure that I understand the lessons.  
	</fieldset>
	<fieldset id="ge">
		<legend class="font-effect-outline">Favorite GE so far and why</legend>
		My favorite GE so far is ARTS1 because I have a great interest in art.
		One of my dreams is to travel around the world to visit the different museums and historic sites found in different countries.
	</fieldset>
	<fieldset id="pl">
		<legend class="font-effect-outline">Favorite programming language so far and why</legend>
		My favorite programming language is between Python and Java. 
		Although I usually use Java whenever I make the exercises of my other CMSC subjects, Python makes it more readable than Java which helps when documenting. Another reason that I prefer these two languages is that there are a lot of resources online to check whenever I run into a problem while coding.

		<legend class="font-effect-outline">Favorite food</legend>
		My favorite foods are usually sweet foods like chocolate and ice cream.

	<fieldset id="hobby">
		<legend class="font-effect-outline">Hobbies</legend>
		I like to watch anime and play games with my friends when I have the time. Although I prefer gardening and painting recently since I can reduce my screentime during my free time.

	<fieldset id="dream">
		<legend class="font-effect-outline">What was your childhood dream</legend>
		I wanted to be a nurse or a teacher. Unfortunately, I had a fear of blood (not sure if I have outgrown it) and I have a hard time communicating myself in front of a lot of people.
